# Agora Project
This is a prototype of the proposal to apply Blockchain to UN Sustainable Development Goal 5, [Gender Equality](https://www.un.org/development/desa/disabilities/envision2030-goal5.html). 
In particular, with SDS 5.5: 
>Ensure womenâ€™s full and effective participation and equal opportunities for leadership at all levels of decision making in political, economic and public life.

It was presented in the Challenge day, in [Blockchain Convergence Congress (Malaga)](https://blockchainconvergence.com/global-blockchain-challenge/). 

The proposal is also in line with new regulation for 2020, where big companies must include social reporting in the annual reports, including gender equality indicators. 

##Description

The company must enroll to be able to report indicators about total executives and women executives at the top 3 levels of management. 
Out of those indicators, Key Performing Indicators are calculated and according to KPIs levels, tokens are granted to the company as a reward. The tokens can be traded later by other benefits with other companies or public institutions in this system.

##Implementation

The prototype is implemented by several smart contracts in Solidity (Ethereum) and a web app based on React. 

##How to Run it 
You need node v10, truffle and ganache installed on your machine. 
Run ganache. 
Download the repository and run 
```
npm install
truffle migrate
``` 
From truffle migrate log, copy the contract address for Factory contract. 
Replace that address in file ethereum/factory.js 

Then run 
```
npm run dev
```

Finally, open a web browser and enter url: localhost:3000 

Enjoy!
